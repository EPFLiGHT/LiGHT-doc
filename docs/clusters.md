# Connecting to the clusters

Throughout your work at LiGHT, you will need to run some heavy computations (whether for inference or training). LiGHT has access to many different services to run those computations

- [EPFL RCP](clusters/rcp.md): a cluster hosted at EPFL. This cluster should be used for inference, small training and experiments on small models
- [SwissAI CSCS](clusters/intro_cscs.md): a cluster maded by SwissAI. This cluster should be used for larger training on bigger models.
