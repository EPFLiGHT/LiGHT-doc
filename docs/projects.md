  1. MultiMeditron

  This project is about making Meditron multimodal: the user can provide Meditron with medical images, in addition to text. Work is two-fold: adapting the codebase of Meditron to make it have a multimodal architecture, and making the "expert" models that process the images and make embeddings fed to Meditron.
