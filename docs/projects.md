# Projects for Fall 2025

## 1. Meditron

  1. MultiMeditron

  This project is about making Meditron multimodal: the user can provide Meditron with medical images, in addition to text. Work is two-fold: adapting the codebase of Meditron to make it have a multimodal architecture, and making the "expert" models that process the images and make embeddings fed to Meditron.

  2. Meditron Reasoning

  3. Meditron Safety

  4. Polyglot Meditron

  Speaking English is nice, most content online is in English. Having a performant LLM for medical tasks formulated in English is useful. But not enough! In low-resource settings and even in most places of the globe, people usually prefer using their first language rather than English.

  This project aims at making Meditron models more proficient in other languages, with a focus on low-resource languages. Work is needed, since having a polyglot base model is generally not enough: popular models do not have a focus on low-resource languages, and there is also a need to make sure to teach the model non-English medical terminology.

## 2. MMORE

MMORE stands for Massive Multimodal Open RAG & Extraction, it is our Python library for a scalable multimodal pipeline for processing, indexing, and querying multimodal documents.

## 4. HIC-Lab AI Bootcamp

Very cool project about teaching the basics of AI applied to healthcare. The target audience is healthcare workers and computer scientists in Rwanda. Our work in LiGHT is to improve the content of the bootcamp so that students learn better, and mentor students there, guide them throughout their completion of the bootcamp.
