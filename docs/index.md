# Welcome to LiGHT

LiGHT stands for Laboratory for Intelligent Global Health and Humanitarian Response Technologies

If you are new to LiGHT, start by reading the [Getting Started tutorial](gettingstarted.md)

## Projects

If you are a student interested in joining LiGHT (or just curious about what we do), you
can explore our ongoing projects in the [Projects section](projects.md)

## Clusters

Modern LLMs requires an unresonable amount of computational resources. As such, to develop
and test our models, we have access to multiple clusters. If you are part of the laboratory,
and want to learn more about how to use them, check the [Clusters section](clusters.md)

Please refer to your supervisor or the lab admin for any questions regarding access to the clusters.

## Documentation

This documentation is a work in progress. If you have any suggestions or want to contribute,
please reach out to the lab admin or open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EPFLiGHT/LiGHT-doc/tree/main)
